# Personas - Recurring Ops Workflow SaaS

## Primary Persona: Admin (Organizer)
**Who:** The person accountable for recurring work getting done (house admin / ops lead).  
**Goals:**
- Set up recurring workflows quickly (minutes, not hours)
- Ensure tasks are completed on time with minimal follow-up
- Keep work distribution fair and transparent
- See what’s overdue and intervene early
**Pain points:**
- Ownership is unclear; reminders are manual
- People claim “I didn’t know it was mine”
- Uneven workload creates conflict
- No single view of what’s overdue / failing
**Key jobs (JTBD):**
- “Create a repeatable system for recurring work so I don’t have to chase people.”
**Key actions in product:**
- Create workflow templates and schedules
- Define rotation/assignment rules
- Invite members and assign roles
- Review dashboard (overdue, trends) and adjust

## Secondary Persona: Member (Contributor)
**Who:** The participant who completes assigned tasks (roommate / team member).  
**Goals:**
- Know exactly what I need to do and by when
- Complete tasks quickly with minimal friction
- Feel work distribution is fair
**Pain points:**
- Tasks buried in chats; unclear definition of “done”
- Forgetting deadlines; getting pinged repeatedly
- Feeling others don’t do their share
**Key jobs (JTBD):**
- “Tell me what I need to do next so I can finish it fast and move on.”
**Key actions in product:**
- View “My Tasks” (due/overdue)
- Complete tasks, add comment if unclear
- Get reminders and stay on track

## Persona assumptions (to validate)
- Admins will create workflows if time-to-first-workflow is under 3 minutes
- Members will adopt if “My Tasks” is clear and reminders are non-annoying
- Round-robin rotation is “fair enough” for MVP; weighted rotation is v2
