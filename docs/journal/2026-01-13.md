# Build Journal — 2026-01-13

## Summary
Completed Step 2 discovery artifacts: personas + user journeys (FigJam). Prepared to move into MVP scope and PRD.

## What I completed today
- Built User Journeys in FigJam:
  - Journey 1: Admin creates a recurring workflow (Happy Path)
  - Journey 2: Member completes assigned work (Happy Path)
  - Journey 3: Admin monitors & intervenes (MVP-lite)
- Added instrumentation events across journeys to support analytics and later dashboards:
  - workflow_create_started, tasks_generated, reminders_configured, workflow_published
  - my_tasks_viewed, task_opened, task_completed
  - dashboard_viewed, overdue_list_viewed, nudge_sent
- Defined usability targets and guardrails:
  - Time-to-first-workflow < 3 minutes (Admin)
  - Find “Due Today” < 10 seconds; complete a task < 60 seconds (Member)
  - Accidental completion rate < 5% (undo/reopen)

## Artifacts created / updated
- Personas: [docs/research/personas.md](../research/personas.md)
- User journeys (FigJam): completed; export pending upload to `docs/assets/user-flows-mvp-v1.png`

## Key decisions
- Keep “Reassign task” as **Later (v1.5)** to avoid expanding MVP scope.
- Remove “overloaded” from Journey 3 success criteria to align with Opportunity Tree (Workload view is Later).
- Keep comments as MVP-lite (lightweight support for “definition of done”).

## Open questions
- Should Dashboard be included in MVP v1 or treated as MVP-lite?
- What default reminder schedule is effective without being annoying?

## Next step (Step 2.3)
- Export FigJam user flows and upload to GitHub (`docs/assets/user-flows-mvp-v1.png`) + link from README
- Draft MVP scope: `docs/roadmap/mvp-scope-v1.md` (features, screens, acceptance criteria)
- Draft PRD v1: `docs/prd/prd-v1.md`
