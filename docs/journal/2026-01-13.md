# Build Journal - 2026-01-13

## Summary
Completed Step 2 (Discovery → Definition): personas, user journeys, MVP scope, PRD, analytics plan, prioritization, risks/assumptions, release plan, and alternatives scan. Ready to move into wireframes and delivery planning.

## What I completed today
- Built User Journeys in FigJam:
  - Journey 1: Admin creates a recurring workflow (Happy Path)
  - Journey 2: Member completes assigned work (Happy Path)
  - Journey 3: Admin monitors & intervenes (MVP-lite)
- Added instrumentation events across journeys to support analytics and later dashboards:
  - workflow_create_started, tasks_generated, reminders_configured, workflow_published
  - my_tasks_viewed, task_opened, task_completed
  - dashboard_viewed, overdue_list_viewed, nudge_sent
- Defined usability targets and guardrails:
  - Time-to-first-workflow < 3 minutes (Admin)
  - Find “Due Today” < 10 seconds; complete a task < 60 seconds (Member)
  - Accidental completion rate < 5% (undo/reopen)

## Artifacts created / updated
- Personas: [docs/research/personas.md](../research/personas.md)
- User journeys (FigJam) export: [docs/assets/user-flows-mvp-v1.png](../assets/user-flows-mvp-v1.png)
- MVP scope v1: [docs/roadmap/mvp-scope-v1.md](../roadmap/mvp-scope-v1.md)
- PRD v1: [docs/prd/prd-v1.md](../prd/prd-v1.md)
- Analytics plan: [docs/analytics/event-tracking-plan.md](../analytics/event-tracking-plan.md)
- Prioritization (RICE/MoSCoW): [docs/roadmap/prioritization-v1.md](../roadmap/prioritization-v1.md)
- Risks & assumptions: [docs/roadmap/risks-and-assumptions.md](../roadmap/risks-and-assumptions.md)
- Release plan v1: [docs/roadmap/release-plan-v1.md](../roadmap/release-plan-v1.md)
- Alternatives scan: [docs/research/alternatives-scan.md](../research/alternatives-scan.md)

## Key decisions
- Keep “Reassign task” as **Later (v1.5)** to avoid expanding permissions/audit complexity in MVP.
- Remove “overloaded” from Journey 3 success criteria to align with the Opportunity Tree (Workload view is Later).
- Keep comments as MVP-lite (lightweight support for clarifying “definition of done”).
- Use a minimal reminder schedule in MVP and validate impact via A/B test + pilot.

## Open questions
- Should Dashboard be included in MVP v1 or treated as MVP-lite?
- What default reminder schedule is effective without being annoying?

## Next step (Step 3)
- Create MVP wireframes (Figma/FigJam) for Admin + Member screens
- Convert MVP scope into a delivery backlog (GitHub Issues + Project board)
- Decide build approach (Bubble vs Next.js + backend) and start implementation of the core workflow loop
