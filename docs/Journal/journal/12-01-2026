Project

Recurring Ops Workflow SaaS (demo vertical: roommate chores) 

A multi-tenant workflow product that automates recurring responsibilities with ownership, reminders/escalations, evidence, approvals, audit logs, and analytics.

Why I’m building this
Recurring work fails when it’s managed informally (chat + memory). Ownership becomes unclear, tasks slip, and teams/households end up with friction and no history/audit trail.

Problem statement (v1)
Operations teams (and shared households) struggle to complete recurring responsibilities on time because ownership, rotation, and reminders are managed informally across chats and memory, which leads to missed tasks, friction between people, and lack of an audit trail.

JTBD (Jobs To Be Done)
When I’m responsible for recurring shared tasks in a team/household, I want automatic assignment and reminders with clear accountability, so I can ensure work gets done on time without constant follow-ups or conflict.

Success metric (v1)
Reduce overdue recurring tasks by **40% within 30 days** of adoption.

Target users (initial)
- Roommates / shared households (demo vertical)
- Ops teams (small teams with recurring work): Admin, Manager, Contributor

MVP hypothesis (what I believe)
If I provide a simple way to create recurring workflows with clear ownership and reminders, then teams will complete more tasks on time and reduce overdue items.

What I did today
- Created GitHub repository to document the full product journey
- Confirmed product direction: horizontal workflow platform (roommates as demo)
- Created first build journal entry

Decisions made today
- Keep the product enterprise-grade (multi-tenant concepts, roles, auditability)
- Keep the demo simple (roommate chores) to explain quickly in interviews
- Focus MVP on recurrence + assignment + completion history before integrations

Risks / open questions
- What is the simplest “fair rotation” rule that feels genuinely useful?
- What evidence/approval requirement should be in MVP vs v2?
- Which user persona should I design for first: Admin or Contributor?

Next step (Step 2)
Define:
1) Primary persona (Admin vs Contributor)
2) Core user journey (happy path)
3) MVP Must-Haves (MoSCoW)
